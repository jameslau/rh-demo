# RH-DEMO: CSS EXERCISE #3 / METHOD-1

### Project solution
Overlapping of elements with the same property value. To solve this issue first find the elements `article` and `section` listed in the last selector set remove then from the list of properties. The padding is throwing off the established floating elements of `section` and `aside`. 

Next, give `section` property values of: `border: 20px solid lightgreen;`. This will maintain the illusion of two title boxes to the left while the `aside` module stays to the right.
